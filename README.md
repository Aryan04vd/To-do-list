# To-do-list
This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple web page for managing a task list. The HTML structure includes a header with a form for adding tasks and a main section displaying the task list. CSS provides styling, using custom variables for colors and defining the appearance of elements. The JavaScript functionality handles form submissions, dynamically creating task elements, and enabling editing and deleting tasks. When a user adds a task, a new task element is created with options to edit or delete it. Clicking "Edit" allows the user to modify the task, and clicking "Save" finalizes the edit. Clicking "Delete" removes the task from the list. The overall result is an interactive task management web application with a clean and visually appealing design.
